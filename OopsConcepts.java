	//Polymorphism : ways to do a single task :: method overloading and overriding 
	//Abstraction : hiding implementation and providing functionality
	//Encapsulation : Binding data into single unit.
	//Java Bean : where all methods are private 
	
	//Coupling : how dependent the methods are to each other
	//Cohesion : how independent the methods are to each other 
	
	//Association : One to One , One to Many , Many to One and Many to Many
	
	//They both are used to achieve Association.
	//Aggregation (HAS-A relationship) [weak relationship] : one objects contains other objects part of its state. It represents relationship between the objects.
	//Composition (strong relationship) : one object contains other objects as a part of its state. completely dependent on the other object
	
	//Method : function to tell the behavior.
